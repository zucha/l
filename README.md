# Shopping list project

I created this Project to learn Android, android studio. If you see any bad code pracices, feel free to inform me.

I would like to create simple, fast shoping list application with some small features.

At the moment i use [Out of milk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk) app.
It is ok, but i think it is too complex and with adverts. So i would make my own app - lean and adjusted for my own shopping experience.

## Recycler view

Main work is with Recycler view in MainActivity. Step by sep i have introduce myself with the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).

It is tricky to use swipe for each row and create submenu buttons, but with help of many of tutorials i managed this. In the code you can find some links to tutorials.

## What is next

I have some ideas to improve user experience to make it more useable. So i am ready to o forward, to learn little bit more.

- undo for delete
- Postpone option
- color for each item
