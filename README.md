# Shopping list project

I created this Project to learn Android, android studio.

I would like to create simple, fast shooping list application with some small features.

At the moment i use [Out of milk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk) app.
It is ok, but i think it is too complex and with adverts. So i would make my own app - lean and adjusted for my own shopping experience.

## Todo 

- Return edit option.
- Delete option.
